\begin{abstract}
Approximately 4\% of our world's population is visually impaired, with 65\% of them over age 50. Visual impairment often leads to a loss in independence and diminished sociability, which in turn reduces life satisfaction. Interacting with visually-impaired users, we identified three specific problems: difficulty recognizing those in their surroundings; inability to proactively greet persons entering their social space; and not knowing if the person they are interacting with is within hearing range as they move around. In this paper, we describe a single-purpose, wearable bracelet with sonifications and vibro-tactile communication that provides low-cost and intuitive assistance to help visually impaired users identify and place potential interactors in their surroundings.  This project presents a first step in the design of intuitive audio-haptic devices that might benefit not just the visually-impaired, but also people with memory challenges or difficulty recognizing faces.
